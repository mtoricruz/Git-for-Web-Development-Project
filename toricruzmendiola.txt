    HTML that gives meaning to our content such as nav, div, h1-h6, etc.

    2. What is HTML used for? 
    To code the layout and structure of a website. If we were to compare it to building a home,
    HTML would be the equivalent of the foundation, wooden frames, the roof, the piping, etc.

    Attributes are additional information within an element.

    #1 <a> tag requires a "href" attribute.
    #2 <img> tag requires a "src" tag.

    6. What do we put in the head of our HTML document? 
    meta data is put in the head of HTML docs. This cannot be seen on the actualy webpage.

    7. What is an id? 
    An id is a specified class within an element.

    8. What elements can I add an id to? 
    All HTML elements (div,h1-h6,p,span,etc.)

    9. How many times can I use the same id on a page? 
    One time.

    10. What is a class? 
    A class helps call upon elements with the class name so they can get the same style.

    11. What elements can I add a class to? 
    A class can also be added to all HTML elements (div,p,h1-h6,etc.)

    12. How many times can I use the same class on a page? 
    Multiple times as long as you want the same style for those classed elements.

    13. How do I get my link to open in a new tab?
    If your link code said <a href="https://www.example.com">example.com</a>
    Then you just add target="_blank" in between the last quote of the url and the >example.com</a>

    14. What is the alt attribute used for? 
    An alt attribute specifies text for an image. This is useful if the image is loading too slow due to 
    slow connection. I've also learned elsewhere that alt attribute text helps with SEO.

    15. How do I reference an id?
    #idname

    16. What is the difference between a section and a div
    Sections represent part of content within a webpage (ex: Header/About/Contact/Footer), while a div tag can

    h2{
    
    }

    19. What is the difference between a class and an id? - Give me an example of when I might use each one
    A specific class can only be called once while a specific id can be called multiple times as long as you want them to be styled the same.
    You might use a .class to style just the main header of a website. But use multiple ids within a section to be styled similar. 

    20. How do we select classes in CSS?
    .classname

    21. How do we select a p element with a single class of “human””?
    p.human

    22. What is a parent child selector? When would this be useful? 
    The ability to select elements that are "direct children" of other elements. 
    This would be useful if you want to style a specific code element that's nested inside other elements.

    23. How do you select all links within a div with the class of sidebar?
    .sidebar a{

    }
    .href
    input[type=text]
    24. What is a pseudo selector?
    A pseudo selector helps select a type of element that is in a specific state. This can be helpful because it cuts the amount of code
    that needs to be written to target elements that we'd like to call on.

    33. How do I remove a file via the command line? Why do I have to be careful with this? 
    rm <filename> 
    I have to be careful with this because there is no warning and it's irreversible.

    34. Why should I use version control?
    Version control allows you to record changes over time and will help when you need to recall specific versions later.

    37. Walk me through Lambda's git flow. 
    #1: Create my own version of Repo by forking the project
    #2: Add my TL as a Collaborator
    #3: Clone my Repo
    #4: Use cd to go to the directory where I want to clone my forked Repo
    #5: Use git clone <link-to-repo> command to clone the repo to the directory i'm currently in
    #6: cd into the new repo using the cd <repo-name> command
    #7: Use git checkout -b 'toricruz-mendiola' to create my own branch for the repo
    #8: Throughout the project, I'd add changes by using both git add . and git commit -m "message" to update my progress and save.
    #9: Each time that happened i would use git push -u origin toricruz-mendiola to push all my commits in my machine to github.
    #10: Once I'm finished I can submit a Pull Request(PR) so I'd go back to my forked project repo on github and click on granch: master
    #11: Click my name-branch and then click New pull request
    #12: Once on the PR page, i'll click the dropdown button that says base repository and change it to my forked repo instead of the lambda one.
    #13: Then I will add my TL to the Reviewers and then Submit the pull request
